## How It Works

### Behind the Scenes

1. **Configuration Check**: Reads your default project from `~/.claude/commands/.tfs-tickets-config`
2. **PAT Authentication**: Uses your `TFS_PERSONAL_TOKEN` environment variable
3. **TFS API Calls**:
   - Query 1: Fetch assigned work items
   - Query 2: Fetch @mentioned work items
   - Query 3: Get full details for each ticket
4. **AI Analysis**: Analyzes each ticket for priority and insights
5. **HTML Generation**: Creates beautiful report with embedded CSS
6. **Browser Opening**: Opens report automatically in your default browser

### Priority Scoring

Tickets are scored based on:
- **State**: In Progress (high), New (medium), Done (low)
- **Type**: Bug (high), Task/PBI (medium), Epic (low)
- **Keywords**: CRITICAL, ERROR, BROKEN, SLOW, etc.
- **Priority Field**: 1 (high), 2-3 (medium), 4+ (low)
- **Severity**: 1-Critical (high), 2-High (medium), 3-Medium (medium)

**Final Priority**:
- Score â‰¥ 60 â†’ **HIGH** (red)
- Score 30-59 â†’ **MEDIUM** (yellow)
- Score < 30 â†’ **LOW** (blue)

## Multi-Project Workflows

### Multiple Projects, One User

If you work across multiple projects:

**Set your primary project as default**:
```
/tfs-tickets setup TIP          # TIP is your primary
```

**Use specific project when needed**:
```
/tfs-tickets                    # Uses TIP (default)
/tfs-tickets Engineering        # Temporarily uses Engineering
/tfs-tickets Marketing          # Temporarily uses Marketing
/tfs-tickets                    # Back to TIP (default)
```

**Change your default anytime**:
```
/tfs-tickets setup Engineering  # Now Engineering is default
/tfs-tickets                    # Uses Engineering
```

---

## System Requirements

- **Claude Code**: Installed and configured
- **TFS Access**: Valid PAT token with "Work Items (Read)" permission
- **OS**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, or Linux with curl
- **Browser**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)

---

## Security

### PAT Token Storage

Your PAT token is stored as an environment variable (`TFS_PERSONAL_TOKEN`):
- **Windows**: Stored in Windows Registry (encrypted at rest)
- **Mac/Linux**: Stored in shell profile (~/.bashrc)

**Best practices**:
- Never share your PAT token
- Regenerate tokens every 90 days
- Use minimum permissions (Work Items: Read only)
- Never commit tokens to git

### HTML Reports

Reports are saved locally to `~/Documents/TFS-Reports/`:
- Not uploaded to any server
- Not shared automatically
- You control who sees them
- Can be deleted anytime

---

## Troubleshooting

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues and solutions.

Quick fixes:

**"PAT token not set"**
- Set environment variable (see First-Time Setup)
- Restart Claude Code

**"Project not found"**
- Check project name at https://tfs.deltek.com/tfs/Deltek
- Update: `/tfs-tickets setup CorrectProjectName`

**"No tickets found"**
- Try more days: `/tfs-tickets 7`
- Verify you have assigned tickets in TFS

**Browser doesn't open**
- Check report location in terminal output
- Open manually: `~/Documents/TFS-Reports/`

## Updating the Command

When a new version is released:

1. **Copy new version** from file share:
   ```bash
   copy \\shared-drive\claude-commands\tfs-tickets.md %USERPROFILE%\.claude\commands\
   ```

2. **Overwrite when prompted**: Yes

3. **Your configuration is preserved**: The config file (`.tfs-tickets-config`) is separate and won't be overwritten

4. **Check version**: The first lines of `tfs-tickets.md` show the version number
